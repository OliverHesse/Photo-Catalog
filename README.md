Link: [Photo Catalog v1](https://oliverhesse.github.io/Photo-Catalog/)

Inital client version complete(still need to finish admin version lol)<br>
not all tagged images are displayed
<br>image-src: [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14BNBG1FBrAhz9r95GnrA_uoxLGFdv4FO)


once i have finished i want to try and make a template version,<br>
that allows multiple types of remote file access, so others can use it.

TODO:
=
- improve UI
- dont remove already loaded images that have matching tags
- find some way to make images format nicer
- add some sort of image data? like a description
- add sorting options mainly date taken
- clean up code and naming conventions
